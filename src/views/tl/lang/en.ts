</br>
<h4>5. AN OVERVIEW OF THE PERSONAL DATA WE PROCESS</h4>
For your understanding, personal data is information that directly identifies you (such as your
  name or photo picture) or enables us to indirectly identify you (for example, on the basis of a
  user ID linked with the personal information in your profile).
  You will find more detailed information on our processing activities below. We generally
  process the following categories of personal data for the following reasons:
</br>&nbsp;

<article><b>a. Profile data (master data)</b></article>
<article><h5>This includes your name, email address, password, telephone number, country,
and age</br>
Why do we process this category?</br>
This data is your master data, which we absolutely need for you to use our
platform. Without an email address/telephone number and a password, you
cannot create a profile. Together with your name, this is your master data. We
need your age to ensure that you are not a minor.
</br>&nbsp;</article>
<article><b>b. Delivery data</b></article>
<article><h5>This includes your name, delivery address, phone number, order details, and
order ID.</br>
Why do we process this category?</br>
In accordance with the principle of data minimization, we only provide our
riders, shops, and restaurants with the information that they need from you to
prepare and deliver your order</br>&nbsp;</article>
<article><b>c. Order history data</b></article>
<article><h5>This includes your order history, selected shops or restaurants (as the case may
  be), invoices, order ID, comments on orders, information on the payment
  method, delivery address, successful orders and canceled orders.</br>
  Why do we process this category?</br>
  Each time you place an order, this information will be added to your profile.
  You can view all this information in your profile at any time. We will use this
  information to improve our services and optimize the platform for your
  interests.
  </br>&nbsp;</article>
<article><b>d. Location data</b></article>
<article><h5>This includes your address, postcode, city, country, as well as your device’s
longitude and latitude.</br>
Why do we process this category?</br>
We need this data to be able to deliver your orders (or enable the restaurant or
  shop you have ordered from to deliver it to you). We create the longitude and
  latitude automatically in order to be able to process your delivery address in
  our other linked systems, such as our Rider app, and to display your address to
  our riders.
  </br>&nbsp;</article>
<article><b>e. Device information and access data</b></article>
<article><h5>This includes your device ID or other device identification, operating system
and corresponding version, time of access, configuration settings, and your IP
address.
</br>
Why do we process this category?</br>
Each time you access our platform this information is stored by us for
technical reasons. We also use parts of this information to detect suspicious
behavior at an early stage and to protect our platform.
</br>&nbsp;</article>
<article><b>f. Customer care data</b></article>
<article><h5>This includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, or ID
from any social media (if applicable).
</br>
Why do we process this category?</br>
If you contact us, we collect this data because we need to know who we are
talking to and what we have been talking about so that we can help you with
your reason for contacting us. This also applies if you leave comments on
social media on our fan pages. We do not combine this data with your profile
data on our platform, but we can still identify you by your social media ID.</br>&nbsp;</article>
<article><b>g. Marketing contact and communications data</b></article>
<article><h5>This includes your name, email address, telephone number, and device ID.</br>
Why do we process this category?
</br>
If you would like to receive an email, an SMS, or an in-app push notification
from us, we need certain information to send you the messages. Instead of
addressing you with "Hey You", we find it more customer-friendly to address
you with your name. This category of personal data is also used by us to
contact you, for example, if a product cannot be delivered and we want to
offer you an alternative instead.

this goal, several software-based monitoring mechanisms run in parallel and
prevent potential attackers from accessing our platform at all.
The decision-making process is automated and could potentially have an
impact on the use of your registered account on our platform. If any such
decision leads to a negative result for you and you do not agree with this, you
can contact us at cs@tt.vip . In this case, we will individually assess the

<article><b>c. Direct marketing</b></article>
<article><h5>Newsletters and user surveys by email and/or text message</br>
If you have provided us with your email address when signing up for our
platform, we will send you by email, SMS or other text message regular offers
of goods or services similar to those offered on our platform. We are
constantly striving to improve our services. Your constructive feedback is very
important to us. Therefore, our direct marketing newsletters might also include
surveys where we ask for your honest feedback. We will occasionally also
send you customer surveys and ask you to give us your opinion.
</br>&nbsp;</br>
You may withdraw your consent for us to send you all marketing materials by
submitted your request via email to cs@tt.vip . Your withdrawal of consent for
marketing purposes will not affect your ability to use our services provided on
our website and app.</br>&nbsp;</br>
You may also unsubscribe to our marketing newsletter sent via emails by
clicking on the “unsubscribe” button at the end of the email.</br>&nbsp;</br>
If you have objected to receiving such communications when registering your
account, or at a later point in time, you will not receive any direct marketing
emails. You are of course always free to opt-out of such emails. In this case,
we will store your contact details in a list of customers who have objected to
receiving direct marketing, to make sure we can continuously comply with
your objection.
</br>&nbsp;</br>
Not only do the contents of our newsletters and surveys vary, but so do the
technologies and criteria we use to design our newsletters and segment
customer groups. For example, a group of customers may receive a special
newsletter promoting special deals from restaurants where customers have
ordered. Other newsletters may refer to specific products that relate to a
particular flavor, such as sushi, Indian cuisine or pizza. We use different
information from your order history and delivery addresses to create these
tailor-made offerings for you. Please be also aware that we are recording, in a
pseudonymous manner, key performance indicators to assess the effectiveness
of our direct marketing campaigns. This includes aggregated information
about the opening and click-through rate for our direct marketing messages.
</br>&nbsp;</br>
This is a profiling process in which we automatically process your data. The
specific customer segmentation will not have a legal effect on you, nor will it
similarly significantly affect you. The only effect you will notice are
interesting offers on our platforms, bespoke to your interests and meal
preferences.
</br>&nbsp;</br>
Nonetheless, if this automated decision-making leads to a negative result for
you and you do not agree with this, you can contact us at cs@tt.vip. In this
case, we will opt you out of customized newsletter communications and you
will no longer receive any such messages going forward.

ATTENTION: As already mentioned, you are entitled to object to the use of
your email address for the aforementioned advertising purposes at any time,
and free of charge, with effect for the future by changing your message
preferences, using the “unsubscribe” button at the end of a newsletter, or by
contacting us to the email address already mentioned. For this purpose, you
only incur transmission costs according to the basic tariffs.</br>&nbsp;</br>
<b>App notifications</b>
We have a strong interest in informing you about new restaurants or deals
when using our app. We are always working to give you an amazing customer
experience. To achieve this, we negotiate very good deals for you with our
restaurant partners. To inform you about these deals, we may send you in-app

<article><h5>Convincing potential customers that we offer an amazing customer

key business priorities. In order to reach as many potential customers as
possible, we are very active in the field of online marketing. As a
consequence, we conduct the following online marketing activities to attract
new customers to our platform:</br>&nbsp;</article>
<article><b>● Targeting</b></article>
<article><h5><h3>○ In principle, targeting means simply showing online advertisements (e.g. by
  showing banners on websites, or delivering ads on social media service
  timelines) tailored to specific target groups. We strive to deliver to you only
  advertisements that are in fact relevant for your interests and bring added
  value to your online experience.
  </h3>
<h3>○ In our targeting process, as a first step, we define a target group based on
certain criteria such as location, age or meal preferences and, secondly, we
commission our service providers to show our advertising to the defined target
group, both on our own websites as well as on online properties owned and
operated by third-party publishers. To better define the intended target groups,
we segment customer types and place different ads on different portals. We
will use pseudonymous data for this purpose only. That means we will not be
able to identify individual persons within the defined target groups.

<article><b>● Retargeting</b></article>
<article><h5><h3>○ As soon as you have visited our platform and, for example, have already
placed an order in your shopping cart, we record this information through
cookies and other web-tracking technologies. If you continue to surf other
websites, our advertising partners will remind you on our behalf that you have
not yet completed your order. We don't want you to miss out on our amazing
customer experience.

<h4>7. WHOM WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH</h4>
We never give your data to unauthorized third parties. However, to run our business
efficiently, we obtain the services of selected service providers and give them limited and
strictly monitored access to some of our data, in order to fulfill the Purposes. However,
before we forward personal data to these partner companies for processing on our behalf,
each individual company undergoes an audit. All data recipients must meet the legal data
protection requirements and undertake to protect their personal data to a comparable standard
as required under applicable data protection laws.


<article><b>a. Service providers and data processors</b></article>
<h5>We use different service providers for our daily processing activities. Most of these
providers process your personal data as so-called “data processors” in accordance
with the requirements of the Personal Data Protection Act 2010. This means they are
permitted to process any personal data only according to our instructions and have no
claims whatsoever to process your personal data for their own, independent purposes.
We also monitor our processors and include only those who meet our high data
protection standards.
</h5>

<article><b>b. Third parties</b></article>
<h5>In addition to data processors, we also work with third parties, to whom we also
transmit your personal data, but who are not bound by our instructions. These are, for
example, our consultants, lawyers or tax consultants who receive your data from us on
the basis of a contract and process your personal data for legal reasons or to protect
our own interests. We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties under any
circumstances. This will never take place without your explicit, informed consent.
</h5>

<article><b>c. Prosecuting authorities, courts, and other public bodies</b></article>
<h5>There are also instances where we are required to disclose our personal data to law
enforcement agencies, government and regulatory bodies in order to comply with the
legal obligations or disclosure is deemed necessary in order to detect or prevent crime,
or for the purpose of a criminal investigation or legal action.</h5>
<h4>8. HOW LONG WE STORE YOUR DATA</h4>
We generally delete your personal data after the Purposes have been fulfilled. The exact
deletion rules are defined in our global policies and supporting local retention schedules.
Different deletion rules apply depending on the purpose of the processing. Within our
deletion concepts, we have defined various data classes and assigned regular maximum
retention and deletion periods to them. When the retention period has expired, the stored data
will be deleted accordingly. If you have not used your user account on our platform for a
period of more than three years, we will delete your account to make sure to comply with the
principle of storage limitation. Before this happens, you will receive a separate notification
from us to the email address registered for your user account.</br>
In addition to the deletion rules, we have defined ourselves, there are other legal retention
periods that we must also observe. For various legal documents, such as invoices or business
letters, applicable law defines minimum retention periods. For example, tax data must be kept
for a period of between six and ten years or even longer in some cases. These special
retention periods vary according to local legal requirements.
</br>
Furthermore, we will continue to store your data if we have a right to do so in accordance
with Art. 17 (3) GDPR or as required under other applicable laws. This applies in particular if
we need your personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
<h4>9. HOW YOU CAN EXERCISE YOUR DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</h4>
You may exercise your data subject rights set out in paragraph 3 above by using the functions
provided in your user account (where applicable, for the deletion and correction of personal
data) or sending an email to cs@tt.vip. We will process such requests in accordance with this
Privacy Policy and our obligations under applicable laws. However, your withdrawal of
consent for certain Purposes may mean that we will not be able to continue providing our
services to you.
</br>
We will require sufficient identification information from you in order to ascertain your
identity as well as understand the nature of your request in order for us to respond
accordingly.</br>
We may charge you a reasonable fee for the handling and processing of your requests to
access your personal data. If we so choose to charge, we will provide you with a written
estimate of the fee we will be charging. Please note that, where permitted under applicable
laws, we are not required to respond to or deal with your requests unless you have agreed to
pay the requested fee.
<h4>10. RIGHT OF MODIFICATION</h4>
We reserve the right to change this privacy notice to ensure compliance with relevant legal
and statutory provisions. We will inform you of any significant changes, such as changes of
purpose or new purposes of the processing.
<h4>11. DISCLAIMER</h4>
We will take reasonable legal, organizational, and technical measures to ensure that your
Personal Data is protected. This includes measures to prevent Personal Data from getting lost,
or used, or accessed in an unauthorized way. We limit access to your Personal Data to our
employees on a need-to-know basis. Those processing your Personal Data will only do so in
an authorized manner and are required to treat your information with confidentiality.
</br>&nbsp;
</br>
Nevertheless, please understand that the transmission of information via the internet is not
completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot
guarantee the security of your Personal Data transmitted through any online means, therefore,
any transmission remains at your own risk.
